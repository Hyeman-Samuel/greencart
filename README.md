## Inspiration üí°

The growing environmental crisis caused by unsustainable shopping habits inspired our team to create GreenCart. Many consumers lack awareness of the impact their purchases have on the planet. Our goal was to develop a mobile app that provides eco-friendly alternatives, educates users, and promotes sustainable shopping.
